# Unity Search Material by Shader  
## About  
A basic Unity editor window that allows you to find materials by shader. Made using Unity version 2021.3 LTS.

## Purpose  
One time I was trying to find a way to select the materials in my project by their shader. But I couldn't find a way to do it. So that's why I created this editor extension for Unity.
