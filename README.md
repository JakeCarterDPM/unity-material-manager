# Unity Search Material by Shader  
## About  
A basic Unity editor window that allows you to find materials by shader. Made using Unity version 2021.3 LTS.

## Purpose  
One time I was trying to find a way to select the materials in my project by their shader. But I couldn't find a way to do it. So that's why I created this editor extension for Unity.  

## How to Use  
1. Install it by placing the SearchMaterialByShader into any folder named "Editor" within your Unity project.
2. At the top tool bar, click "Tools", then "Search Material By Shader"
3. It'll default to the Standard shader, but you can pick any other if you wish.
4. Click find materials.
5. You can now select the material(s) that it has found!
